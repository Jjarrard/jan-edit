"""Running shell commands on the model's behalf, safely.

A 1-3B model will confidently emit nonsense, so the guarantees here are
structural rather than trust-based:

  - Every command is classified BLOCKED / NEEDS_APPROVAL / SAFE before it
    runs. Only a conservative read-only allowlist is SAFE (auto-runnable);
    anything unrecognized needs a human yes, and a small denylist of
    catastrophic or outward-facing commands can't run at all.
  - stdin is /dev/null, so a command that waits for input fails fast instead
    of hanging the agent forever.
  - Everything runs with cwd pinned to the project root, under a wall-clock
    timeout, with output truncated before it reaches the model's context.

This is deliberately not a sandbox: it's a seatbelt around a tool the user
has asked to point at their own project.
